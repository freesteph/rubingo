* Rubingo : a Ruby wrapper around the Scalingo API

** Description

This simple Ruby script started as a wrap around the Scalingo API to
investigate and report on build times.

The native Scalingo CLI also provides duration data but in ASCII
format which requires serious grep/awk skills to parse. It's also a
lot more fun in Ruby.

** Getting started

1. get yourself an access token by [[https://dashboard.scalingo.com/account/tokens][creating an API token]] and write it
   into a ~SCALINGO_API_TOKEN~ environment variable;
2. explore ~./bin/rubingo --help~.

Example :

#+begin_src sh
export SCALINGO_API_TOKEN=my token

./bin/rubingo token # grab and write an exchange token in .env

./bin/rubingo repl betagouv-site # explore the betagouv-site resources

# if you app is hosted in the Secnum zone:
./bin/rubingo repl betagouv-prod --secnum
#+end_src

the above will drop you into a Ruby prompt with an ~api~ object
instantiated with the right app:

#+begin_src ruby
api.deployments.last(10).map(&:duration)

api.collaborators.map(&:email)
#+end_src

** Ressources available

- ~deployments~ ;
- ~collaborators~.
