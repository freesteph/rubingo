* Scalingo API wrapper

** Description

This simple Ruby script started as a wrap around the Scalingo API to
investigate and report on build times.

The native Scalingo CLI also provides duration data but in ASCII
format that require serious grep/awk skills to parse. It's also more
fun in Ruby.

** Getting started

1. get yourself an access token by [[https://dashboard.scalingo.com/account/tokens][creating an API token]] then
   [[https://developers.scalingo.com/index#authentication][exchanging it for a Bearer token]] ;
2. set the token in a ~SCALINGO_EXCHANGE_TOKEN~ env variable ;
3. run ~irb -r ./src/scalingo_api.rb~;

Don't worry too much about the ~SCALINGO_EXCHANGE_TOKEN~, it expires
in 30 minutes.

** API

#+begin_src ruby
api = ScalingoAPI::API.new("betagouv-site")

data = api.deployments

data.first
#+end_src
